# TempMon

A simple Elixir program to poll a temperature sensor in my room
to tell me how shit the air quality is.

Leverages Ecto + TimescaleDB to create readings on a fixed interval.

Future additions (in order of priority): 

- Add tests, linting, etc. and clean the code up a bit
- Add Grafana dashboards to visualize the data coming in.
- Add some way of notifying myself if something goes wrong (i.e. temperature goes above X)
